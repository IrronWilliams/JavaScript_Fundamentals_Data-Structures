splice() also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements
removes 2 elements beginning with the 3rd element

splice() can take a 3rd parameter. here adding the numbers 13 and 14 to an array

slice() copies, or extracts, a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon

indexOf() allows you to quickly and easily check for the presence of an element on an array. indexOf() takes an 
element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position, or index, of that element, 
or -1 if the element does not exist on the array.

let fruits = ['apples', 'pears', 'oranges', 'peaches', 'pears']
